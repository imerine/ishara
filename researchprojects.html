    <div class="medium-text">Redesigning Georgia's Online DMV: Creating a More User-Friendly Environment for a Government Website</div>
    <div class="small-text">
        In collaboration with my colleague Favour Adakosa, I had the opportunity to work on a fun project for a technology, tools, and tech course – a targeted redesign of Georgia’s DMV website based on data from moderated user interviews. Our goal was to create a layout that would produce a higher rate of user satisfaction, drive more website traffic, and increase browsing efficiency.
        <br><br>
        We got the ball rolling by meeting on the Kennesaw State University campus, conceptualizing the approach we wanted to take toward the DMV’s reimagined layout. To achieve maximum relevancy, we conducted usability tests on DMV website users of various age groups, gathering the positives and negatives they experienced while attempting to complete both simple and complicated tasks.
        <br><br>
        Utilizing collaborative tools such as Figma, Microsoft Excel, and Notion, we analyzed the core issues users faced while navigating the site, brainstormed innovative solutions, and kept each other up to date and on track for any deadlines.
        <br><br>
        We wanted a cohesive look across the entire platform that didn’t sacrifice usability, and that’s exactly what we got. That process was made possible because of constant referrals to user feedback, plenty of communication amongst team-mates, and a fluid workflow. The result was a clean, eye-catching layout that put the users’ main interests front and center.
